Accessibility
*************
- React fully supports building accessible websites, often by using standard HTML techniques

Code Splitting
**************
- Most React apps will have their files bundled using tools like Webpack or Browserify
- Process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a 'bundle'

Context
*******
- provides a way to pass data through the componenet tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
- designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of React components, such as current authenticated user
- apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult
- component composition is often a simpler solution than context

Error Boundaries
****************
- in this past, JavaScript errors inside componenets used to corrupt React's internal state
- React did not provide a way to handle them gracefully in components, and oculd not recover from them
- Error boundaries are react componenets that catch JS errors anywhere in their child componenet tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI
